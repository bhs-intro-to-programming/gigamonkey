      Place items along the x-axis based on how well you think it supports
      learning and along the y-axis based on your opinion of how useful a tool
      current AIs are for the task. Note that you might place something far to
      the right on the x-axis because it would be a great learning tool but
      low on the y-axis because AIs actually aren't good at it yet or vice
      versa, high on the y-axis because AIs are a great tool but on the left
      side of the x-axis because students will learn more by doing the task
      without AI assistance.
