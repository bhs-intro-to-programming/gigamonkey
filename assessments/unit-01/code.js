// Write your code here. Please pay attention to the names of the functions I'm
// asking you to write. If I ask you to write a function named foo and you call
// it something else you will not get full credit for your answer even if
// everything else is correct.

// There are twenty functions to write so allocate your time accordingly. Don't
// get stuck on one question for too long if there are other functions you can
// write more easily.
